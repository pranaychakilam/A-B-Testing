Tactile Entertainment created the wildly famous smartphone puzzle game Cookie Cats. In order to clear the board and advance to the next level in this traditional "connect three" puzzle game, the player must connect tiles of the same hue. There are singing cats in there as well. Players will occasionally come across gates as they advance through the game's stages that require them to wait a significant length of time or spend an in-app purchase in order to pass. These gates serve the crucial function of forcing players to take breaks from playing the game, which should boost and prolong the player's pleasure of the game in addition to encouraging in-app purchases.
But where should the gates be situated? In Cookie Cats, the first gate was initially situated at level 30, but in this notebook, we'll investigate an AB-test in which we moved it to level 40. We'll focus on the effect on player retention in particular. Understanding the data is a crucial step before beginning any analysis, though, so let's get to that first. Now that it's loaded, let's look at it!
